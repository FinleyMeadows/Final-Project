# Mood-Reading Music Finder

The goal of this project was to eliminate the difficulty of finding music when you're feeling a certain way. To solve this issue, my project reads an inputted image of your facial expression, decifers what face you're making, and finally recommends music to match your current mood.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm will start with detecting the facial expression inputted. Once it comes to a conclusion it will link it with an emotion and start looking for a song in the corresponding category. Finally, the algorithm will display a list of 5 songs to choose from based on the emotion detected.

## Running this project

1. Download the dataset @ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noamsegal/affectnet-training-data
2. Download code from github @ https://github.com/FinleyMeadows/Final-Project.git and open in vs code
3. Transfer the dataset into vs code
4. Unzip dataset folder
5. Make sure to keep file names concise
6. Run code to train the model on the dataset
7. input images to test the model, if working correctly it should recommend music correlating with the detected emotion
